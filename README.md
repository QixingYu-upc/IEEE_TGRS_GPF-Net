[GPF-Net: Graph-Polarized Fusion Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10225399)

Configuration
---
* Python 3.8.0

* PyTorch 1.7.0.

* i7-8700K CPU

* NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU

How to Use?
---

* Set up the dataset in the main. py file and change the data path in the data_deader file.

* If the data is too large to exceed the GPU's capacity, the size of the superpixel can be changed.

* Python main. py.
